# Sample Python Project - Teaching Basic Python Syntax

Welcome to the Sample Python Project! This project is designed to teach basic Python syntax to Brunel University students. It provides a simple example of how to structure a Python project, create modules, and use functions effectively.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Python project structure with the following components:

- `package_on/`: A package directory containing the following files:
    - `__init__.py`: An empty file that makes the package importable.
    - `sample.py`: A sample module demonstrating basic Python syntax.
- `main.py`: integrate modules
